      <br><p>
        Located at the corner of Leslie St and Lawerence Ave E, Sunnybrook Park is one of the most gigantic parks in all of the Greater Toronto Area with various trails
        and fields for you to use. It has one of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen with lots of forest, trees and ravines to sightsee as you walk or
        bike through the trails.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is Biking or Hiking your thing? Look no further as the multiple trails at the parks can suit your needs. Or if taking your dog for a walk is what you seek, you can find an off-leash
        dog park to take them to roam around. Outdoor fitness is also another possibility as there is outdoor workout equipment here for everyone to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        This park also has various sports fields for you to play soccer, football or any type of field sport you may want. Here you rarely have to worry about fields being taken up as
        the big acres of land should be sufficient for most people to do their own thing. Unlike other places, this one has a Cricket pitch field if that sport is what you are looking for.
        The options are endless here!

      <h2>McNicoll Park</h2>
      <h5>Last Updated: May 4, 2021</h5>
      <h4 onclick=location.href='https://goo.gl/maps/K9Jxt5CBChxGMokx7'><i class="fas fa-thumbtack"></i>Location: 215 McNicoll Ave, North York, ON</h4>
      <div class="slideshow">

      </div>
      <br><p>
        Looking for a place to go play some pick-up soccer with friends or are you just looking to practice and shoot around? Look no further as McNicoll Park has
        one of the most amazing turf fields in North York. Mesh stays year-round on the field and most of the time you will find other people at the field
        to play some games with.
      </p>
      <p>
        If soccer isnâ€™t your style, you can also find a basketball and tennis court right beside it if those are your type of sports. The basketball court has two hoops
        so you can play a full-court basketball game if you want, and the tennis court has three courts for different people to play multiple games.
      </P>
      <p>
        If you are looking for some new people to play some pickup games with, please visit our Facebook page where there are various groups for the different sports.
