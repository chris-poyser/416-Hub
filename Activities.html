        Toronto soccerplex is one of the best indoor soccer spots that you can visit on the weekends for a quick pickup game with your friends. Usually, from a set time
        between 12-3 PM, you and your friends can visit this place and sign up as a team to play some indoor soccer against other teams. The price is $10 per person and
        the rules are that the winner gets to stay on, and the loser has to rotate with the other teams present. If you don’t have a team don’t be afraid to visit as you
        can just join another random group of people or visit our Facebook page to look for others to play with.
